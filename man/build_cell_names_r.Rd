\title{Find All Possible Conditions}
\usage{
build_cell_names_r(parameter_map_r, factors_r, responses_r)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameter_map_r}{An Rcpp::List where each element is a character
vector mapping parameters to conditions. Names should correspond to
       parameters.}

\item{factors_r}{An Rcpp::List where each element is a character vector of
factor levels. Names should correspond to factor names.}

\item{responses_r}{A character vector (std::vector<std::string>) of response
accumulator names.}
}
\value{
An Rcpp::List with two elements:
\itemize{
  \item \code{cell_names}: Character vector of all possible condition
combinations
  \item \code{sortedFactors}: The processed factor structure used to
  generate  cells
}
}
\description{
Constructs all possible condition combinations (i.e., cells) from
based on experimental factors, parameter mappings, and response
definitions. Returns both cell names and sorted factor definitions.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
  \item Converts R lists to C++ maps for efficient processing
  \item Generates all condition combinations via Cartesian product
  \item Handles special parameter mappings (like response accumulators)
  \item Returns both cell names and the factor structure used
}
}
\section{Typical Workflow}{

This function is typically used to:
\enumerate{
  \item Establish the full experimental design space
  \item Verify factor/parameter compatibility
  \item Generate condition labels for model specification
}
}

# A simple example
p_map <- list(A = "1", B = "1", t0 = "1", mean_v = "M", sd_v = "1",
               st0 ="1")
factors <- list(S = c("s1", "s2"))
responses <- c("r1", "r2")
result <- build_cell_names_r(p_map, factors, responses)

# cat("B (2 factors), t0, mean_v (3 factors), sd_v (2 factors)")
p_map <- list(
    A = "H", B = c("S", "G"), t0 = "E", mean_v = c("D", "H", "M"),
    sd_v = c("D", "M"), st0 = "1"
)

    S = c("s1", "s2", "s3"), D = c("d1", "d2"), E = c("e1", "e2"),
    G = c("g1", "g2", "g3"), H = c("h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5")
)
responses <- c("r1", "r2", "r3")
result <- build_cell_names_r(p_map, factors, responses)
